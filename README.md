# coffee-machine


In order to implement the code with less coupling, make it clean, flexible and reusable, i am taking an approach of dividing the code in MakeDrinkCommand into several classes such that each class has a single responsibility which will indicate a clear separation of code and make it more easier to understand and maintain. 

I am going to distribute the code into several classes such as drink,order,ordervalidation,drinkmaker, etc.
